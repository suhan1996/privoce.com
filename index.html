            Mission Statement
        </h1>

        <h2 class="ui medium header">Build tools to enhance data ownership and privacy!</h2>

        <div class="ui text">
            <p>If Web 1.0 granted netizens the right to view online content, and Web 2.0 has given netizens the right to publish in a participatory manner, Web 3.0 will go one step further and endow netizens personal storage and personal computation.</p>
            <p>A decade ago, the rise of smartphone and mobile internet had revolutionized the Internet and ushered in the app era--where Internet companies conduct business through apps, which provide features in the front end to meet user need and data storage in the back end. A big portion of Internet companies’ revenue is from advertising, and that explains why user data is so important for them. However, data collected by different apps are stored in silos with little interoperability--different apps don’t talk to each other due to the competing relationship between Internet companies, which has led to unfavorable results for both the Internet companies and the users--Internet companies sign treaties to trade user data, and user might have dozens of accounts online while can’t find a way to manage their online data footprints.</p>
            <p>How can we grant every netizen better ownership of personal data? How can netizens gain more representation through better means of participation in today’s data economy? With the rise of cloud computing, the personal cloud model and related content distribution methods have the potential to revolutionize the Internet and live up to the Web 3.0 ideals--the division of labour in data storage, computing, and Internet services. Join me as the pioneers to build out the future of the Internet!</p>

    <!--Overview-->
    <div class="ui text container" id="overview">

        <h1 class="ui horizontal divider header">
            Project Overview
        </h1>

        <div class="ui text">
            <p>The Privoce project originated from the SoLiD (Social Linked Data) concept, which proposes that every user would have a personal data pot and has the right to assign read/write access to third-party services (apps). The core innovation is a middle ground between users and platforms, or a data bank, which serves as a means for users to store and manage their data.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!--Approach-->
    <div class="ui text container" id="approach">

        <h1 class="ui horizontal divider header">
            Our Approach
        </h1>

        <div class="ui text">
            <p>There are many aspects to approach the data ownership problem: Miniprogram adopts a top-down manner to connect the various siloed apps to a centralized platform. As common netizens, the bottom-up product innovation is the only resort we can attract users. We need to boil down the problems to a specific issue we will delve into and develop solutions to improve the experience of a targeted group of users--here are my two cents: “use web technologies to achieve native app experience, but with better data interoperability and better data ownership for our users.”</p>

    <div class="ui text container" id="feature">

        <h1 class="ui horizontal divider header">
            Key Product Features
        </h1>

        <div class="ui text">
            <p>Personal Data Management - the first feature we are developing is a browser extension to help users manage their digital footprints online: to hide digital footprint on selected websites, to be self-aware on how their time is spent online. Moreover, in the remote working scenarios, users on our product can create various project profiles: in each profile there could be a slew of websites, and websites of a kind will automatically flock into a set, i.e., Web App, or mini-program--github, stackoverflow, zhihu, CNN, each set includes the affordances of the website and the historic contents viewed by users.</p>
